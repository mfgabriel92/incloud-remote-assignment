###Introduction
This is a remote assignment given by Incloud as a way to have an impression of how the code is written by those interested in applying to positions at Incloud.
Thanks to this task, I was able to learn a little bit of a new PHP framework, Symfony, and for that, I am thankful.

###The Task
The task took me around 26 hours to complete. I liked the opportunity to learn Symfony and, in general, the amazing libraries to ease other's development time. There isn't anything I disliked.

If I had had more time, I would've used Symfony's own validation of fields. I am very satisfied with the ability to, if one forgets to start the time tracker before working on something, it is possible to pause and alter the time manually, entering the time you've already spend, and unpause to continue the track. And for the improvements, I wanted to make the flash message component clear the incoming message and not show up every time the page is refreshed.

###Thanks
Thank you Incloud for the opportunity.
