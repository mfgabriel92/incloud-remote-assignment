### Introduction

This is a remote assignment given by Incloud as a way to have an impression of how the code is written by those interested in applying to positions at Incloud.
Thanks to this task, I was able to learn a little bit of a new PHP framework, Symfony, and for that, I am thankful.

### The Task

The task took me around 26 hours to complete. I liked the opportunity to learn Symfony and, in general, the amazing libraries to ease other's development time. There isn't anything I disliked.

If I had more time, and also for the improvements, I would've used Symfony's validation modules for the fields instead of using `if`s. I'm satisfied with the solution to, in case one forgets to start the tracker, it is possible to pause the time and modify it manually, then continue the tracking. 

### Thanks

Thank you Incloud for the opportunity.
