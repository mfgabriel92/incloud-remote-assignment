###Introduction
This is a remote assignment given by Incloud as a way to have an impression of how the code is written by those interested in applying to positions at Incloud.
Thanks to this task, I was able to learn a little bit of a new PHP framework, Symfony, and for that, I am thankful.

###The Task
The task took me around 20 hours to complete. I liked the opportunity to learn Symfony, and specifically about the project, I like the libraries available to be used to reduce the development time. I disliked that one of these libraries prevented me from doing one functionality, more specifically the ability to book a time without tracker. So my solution to allow edition of the duration of the task directly from the table, thus in case one forgot to start the timer, it is possible to edit the time after storing it.
